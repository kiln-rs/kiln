# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added native HTML tree construction for implicit `tbody` elements around
  direct table rows, with WPT-like and runnable browser coverage.

## [0.1.0-alpha.31] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Added an in-tree native agent dashboard rendered by tetherscript's software
  HTML/CSS rasterizer and bitmap text stack, with native Unicode prompt input
  and the existing script-owned JSON-RPC agent backend.

### Changed

- Replaced the optional egui/eframe native UI with tetherscript-owned layout,
  rendering, input, and agent state code over the existing native framebuffer
  transport.
- Removed the optional `eframe`, `fontdue`, `iced-x86`, and `object` crates and
  their transitive dependency trees. Native and headless browser rendering now
  share the deterministic in-tree bitmap text renderer.
- Removed the bundled Inter font because native rendering no longer depends on
  an external TrueType rasterizer.

### Fixed

- Cleared each VM call frame's abandoned operand-stack state when returning
  from inside `for` or `while`. Loop iterators and indices could otherwise leak
  into the caller and make a later chained call fail with an unrelated
  "int is not callable" error.
- Repaired the Tera feature's unit-test call path so
  `cargo test --features tera` compiles and exercises the renderer again.

## [0.1.0-alpha.30] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added bitwise operators `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, and `>>` with Rust
  precedence, on both backends. Infix `&` is bitwise AND while prefix `&` remains
  a borrow, so position alone disambiguates them. Operands must be integers:
  `bool & bool` is rejected rather than treated as a non-short-circuiting `&&`,
  because that spelling is nearly always a mistyped `&&`. `>>` is arithmetic and
  preserves the sign bit, and a shift count of 64 or more is a named error rather
  than a silent mask or a debug panic.
- Added UDP socket primitives as owned move-only resources:
  `resource.udp_bind(host, port)` with `send_to`, `recv_from`, `local_addr`, and
  `port`. A received datagram is a `{ bytes, from }` map, since UDP is
  connectionless and the sender belongs to the payload rather than the socket.
- Added the `socket` capability with `--grant-tcp` and `--grant-udp`, taking
  repeatable `host`, `host:port`, or `*` patterns. TCP and UDP are granted
  separately, and `--access-mode full` grants both.

### Fixed

- Closed an ambient-authority hole: `resource.tcp_listen` and
  `resource.tcp_connect` previously reached the network with no grant at all, so a
  script under the default `--access-mode restricted` could bind or dial any
  address. Sockets are now denied by default and report the flag that would allow
  them. UDP sends re-check the destination, so a socket bound under a narrow grant
  cannot be reused to reach an address outside it.

## [0.1.0-alpha.29] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Rejected `&` in infix position with a named parse error instead of silently
  splitting the statement. `let a = 12 & 10;` previously parsed as `let a = 12`
  followed by a discarded `&10` borrow, so it printed `12` and exited 0 rather
  than reporting that tetherscript has no bitwise AND. The error now names both
  alternatives (`&&` for logical and, prefix `&value` to borrow).
- Propagated template ordering type errors instead of swallowing them into
  `false`, so comparing a non-number with `>`, `<`, `>=`, or `<=` now reports
  the offending types rather than silently taking the untaken branch.
- Marked the internal ad-block `Engine` doc example `ignore` so `cargo test
  --doc` compiles again; the module is private to the built-in installation
  path and was never reachable as `tetherscript::adblock::Engine`.

## [0.1.0-alpha.28] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added ad-blocking builtins: `adblock_parse`, `adblock_should_block`, `adblock_cosmetic_selectors`, and `adblock_rule_count` for uBlock-style filter list parsing, network request matching, and cosmetic element hiding.

## [0.1.0-alpha.27] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Added `tetherscript new <directory>` as an explicit project-scaffolding command while preserving `tetherscript init [directory]` compatibility.

## [0.1.0-alpha.26] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Added opt-in native windows, frame presentation, and keyboard/mouse input
  for owned RGBA render surfaces through the `native-window` feature, plus a
  shared view schema for terminal and native UI backends.
- Added move-only owned runtime resources for files, child processes, TCP,
  request/response bodies, tasks, timers, and bounded channels, with recursive
  transfer enforcement at every persistent language boundary.
- Updated the VS Code extension with package-local import-path completion,
  export-aware namespace completion and navigation, namespace-preserving auto
  imports, module diagnostics, hovers, document links, and module snippets.
- Added file-relative modules with explicit `export` declarations, namespaced
  `import "./file.tether" as name` bindings, cycle detection, and package-root
  containment.
- Added local `tetherscript.json` package manifests, `tetherscript init`, nearest
  package discovery, and package-aware `run` and `check` commands.
- Added `https_serve(port, certificate_pem, private_key_pem, handler)` with
  validated PEM certificate chains and private keys.

### Changed

- Replaced the `openssl s_client` subprocess shim with vendored, in-process
  OpenSSL behind the explicit `openssl-tls` feature, including native trust
  roots, certificate-chain and hostname verification, TLS 1.2 minimums, and
  bounded socket I/O.
- Restored a zero-default-dependency core by making OpenSSL, native certificate
  loading, and Tera compatibility explicit opt-in features.
- Updated the HTTPS server example to document the certificate SAN, full chain,
  and browser trust requirements for a genuine secure address-bar indicator.

## [0.1.0-alpha.22] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Declared the standalone Actix server example's required feature so default
  `cargo test` and crates.io package verification do not compile it without Actix.

## [0.1.0-alpha.21] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added `tera_render(template, context[, autoescape])` for rendering Tera
  templates from tetherscript maps in both execution engines.
- Added the optional `actix-web` feature for registering sandboxed tetherscript
  hooks as Actix Web routes, with request/response conversion, blocking-pool
  execution, per-thread runtime caching, and explicit Rust capability injection.
- Added opt-in file-backed Actix controllers with validated hot reload,
  generation-aware cache invalidation, and last-good fallback after invalid edits.
- Added an Actix integration test suite and a standalone native-versus-tetherscript
  PostgreSQL demo with a dependency-free benchmark client.
- Added deterministic WebGL texture objects, texture uploads and sub-image
  updates, sampler state, texture-backed rasterization, integer sampler
  uniforms, varying interpolation, and focused texture/error parity tests.
- Added DOM `CharacterData` behavior with UTF-16-compatible offsets for
  `substringData`, `appendData`, `insertData`, `deleteData`, and `replaceData`.
- Added runnable textured-WebGL examples and WPT-like validation coverage for
  texture sampling, filtering, unpack state, DOM image sources, and errors.

## [0.1.0-alpha.20] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- Added script CLI arguments via `env_args()` and `tetherscript run <file> -- [args...]`.
- Added `tetherscript build <file.tether> -o <output>` standalone launchers that embed scripts and run them with the bytecode VM.

- Event dispatch ordering: capture, target, and bubble phases now fire listeners
  in the correct order with `stopPropagation` blocking later phases and
  `preventDefault` suppressing default actions while allowing continued propagation.
- Form reset default action: `<button type="reset">` and `<input type="reset">`
  now dispatch a cancelable `reset` event on the enclosing form and restore all
  form controls to their initial values (text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons).
- P4 DOM and event parity checklist is now complete.
- CSS/layout rendering evidence: agent-visible `production_debug_report()`
  visual elements now cover flex, absolute positioning, z-index, overflow
  clipping, viewport-responsive width, display:none, visibility:hidden, and
  zero-size elements. P5 checklist is complete.
- Added a WPT-like browser fixture runner with executable DOM event,
  Selectors API, Fetch/CORS, and module-script fixtures, plus unsupported
  behavior notes for each family.
- Expanded the WPT-like browser fixture runner with CSS/layout,
  timers/microtasks, Web Storage, and HTML tree-construction fixture families.
- Added WPT-like negative/error fixtures for invalid selectors, blocked CORS
  responses, missing module chunks, and unsupported HTML parser behavior.
- Added WPT-like browser fixtures for form reset/requestSubmit defaults,
  same-document navigation history, and browser-context cookie/storage
  isolation.
- Added WPT-like browser fixtures for keyboard text insertion, pointer hover
  event ordering, focus-order Tab traversal, file input metadata, and anchor
  download recording.
- Added WPT-like browser fixtures for WebSocket/EventSource message delivery,
  media permission grants, media device exposure, dialog decisions, and
  clipboard read/write behavior.
- Added WPT-like browser fixtures for iframe message delivery metadata,
  cross-origin security policy, 2D canvas/WebGL snapshots, and accessibility
  names/states/focus order.
- Added WPT-like browser fixtures for service worker cache fetches, IndexedDB
  origin sharing, selection text, screenshot visual diffing, and page
  trace/snapshot restore.
- Added WPT-like negative/error fixtures for failed realtime connections,
  denied media permissions, blocked frame messages, missing persisted records,
  and invalid visual/selection locators.
- Added WPT-like browser fixtures for locator/actionability checks,
  drag/drop plus pointer capture, wheel scrolling, viewport/media emulation, and
  browser resource-limit guard behavior.

- Added routed external page-resource loading so missing scripts, module entry
  scripts, stylesheets, images, and source maps can be fulfilled through the
  browser route table with cookies, redirects, CORS validation, route logs, and
  HAR-visible network events.
- Added routed top-level document navigation for JavaScript `location` changes,
  anchor clicks, and GET/POST form submits, including redirect following,
  cookie propagation, POST body preservation, final-URL history commits, and
  HAR-visible navigation entries.
- Added route-backed module-loader coverage for static imports, nested module
  dependency order, modulepreload deduplication, and browser-shaped rejected
  promises for missing dynamic import chunks.
- Added production-debug diagnostics for unhandled promise rejections,
  async/module source-mapped stack evidence, and separate CORS versus route
  abort exception classification.
- Added shadow-boundary composed event-path coverage so events dispatched inside
  open shadow roots bubble through their host chain with browser-shaped
  `composedPath()` evidence.
- Added live `children` and `childNodes` collections so indexed access,
  `length`, `item()`, and `forEach()` reflect DOM mutations after the
  collection object is created.
- Added live document-wide HTMLCollections for `getElementsByTagName`,
  `getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByName`, and named document collections
  such as `document.forms`, including dynamic named property lookup.
- Added DOM default-action coverage for label activation, native anchor
  `location.href` updates, and the browser distinction between `form.submit()`
  and `form.requestSubmit()`, including submitter name/value data for
  `requestSubmit(submitter)`.
- Added a browser parity checklist that grounds follow-up work in current
  contract tests, known gaps, and explicit readiness tests.
- Added native fetch/XHR redirect following for `301`, `302`, `303`, `307`,
  and `308`, including relative `Location` resolution, browser-style method
  rewriting, cookie propagation across hops, final response URLs, and HAR
  entries for the redirect chain.
- Added native CORS handling for fetch/XHR, including cross-origin `Origin`
  headers, credential modes, preflight `OPTIONS` requests, response header
  validation, cross-origin cookie suppression by default, and credentialed
  cookie forwarding when `credentials: "include"` or `withCredentials` is set.

## [0.1.0-alpha.17] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Added an origin-bound `computer` capability so hosts can expose existing
  CodeTether `computer_use` desktop automation as scriptable TetherScript
  actions through explicit `grant_computer`, `computer_scope`, and
  `computer_origin` grants.
- Added contract coverage proving TetherScript plugin scripts can call
  `computer.snapshot()` through a host-granted bridge.

### Fixed

- Fixed plugin test source strings that used literal braces after string
  interpolation support was added.
- Fixed clippy warnings in selection docs and string interpolation rendering.

## [0.1.0-alpha.16] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added native visual element evidence to `BrowserPage::production_debug_report()`,
  including selector candidates, computed styles, visibility, and layout bounds
  for React-style production UI debugging.
- Added React-style controlled form interaction coverage for native agent
  actions: live `value`/`checked` reads, user-like click event ordering,
  prevented submit handling, Enter-to-submit, and HAR-visible POST bodies.
- Added native fetch/XHR server-cookie propagation so `Set-Cookie` login
  responses update the session jar, keep `HttpOnly` hidden from
  `document.cookie`, and authenticate later routed requests with `Cookie`.

## [0.1.0-alpha.15] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Added regression coverage for a React-style ESM `createRoot(...).render(...)`
  flow that mutates the native browser DOM from registered module resources.
- Added browser JavaScript regression coverage for pending `await` microtask
  resolution, Promise `.then()` adoption of handler-returned pending promises,
  and XHR `loadend`/`response`/`responseType` parity used by Axios-style
  production request adapters.
- Added a `tethercstp_browser.tether` example that mounts a React-style app
  through `ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render(...)` and renders the mounted result.
- Expanded experimental browser runtime built-ins with CSS rule introspection,
  computed styles, query selection, text extraction, page snapshots,
  framework-root/resource discovery, and structured display-list output.

### Fixed

- Fixed deterministic module resource resolution so relative imports can match
  registered absolute page paths as well as fully resolved URLs.
- Fixed browser module rewriting for default imports and `export default`
  bindings used by React-style module bundles.
- Removed the external HTTP client dependency from the capability path so the
  crate remains zero-dependency and `cargo install --path .` does not lock or
  download transitive packages.
- Split the HTTP capability authority into focused modules that satisfy the
  changed-file 50-line source ratchet.
- Added zero-Rust-dependency HTTPS support to `http_get`/`http_request` through
  the existing platform TLS shim, including Windows Git OpenSSL discovery.
- Added a live `realm_micro1_login_probe.tether` script that fetches the Realm
  login page through tetherscript and exposes the current production-bundle
  execution gap.
- Added fast diagnostics for unsupported modern JavaScript bundle syntax so
  tetherscript browser probes report the blocking construct instead of timing
  out while parsing large inlined scripts.
- Fixed native browser execution gaps found against the live Realm React login
  bundle, including route-regex `String.prototype.match()` captures,
  `Array.prototype.reduceRight()`, browser `await` unwrapping, deterministic
  pending-promise microtask draining, Promise adoption, and XHR lifecycle
  response fields. The Realm login root now mounts and renders through the
  native tetherscript browser path while the live profile request records its
  401 network event.

## [0.1.0-alpha.14] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added native browser-agent release coverage for external resources, classic
  scripts, module scripts, static module imports, dynamic `import()`, DOM
  assertions, traces, and CLI browser grants.
- Added `BrowserPage::production_debug_report()` with console-error, page-error,
  HAR-style network entries, source-mapped page-error stack frames,
  failed-request, source-map, framework, classified runtime exception, and React
  hydration diagnostics for bundled production UI validation.
- Added source-map resource registration for deterministic production bundles.
- Added a native-browser contract test that rejects external browser engines
  and remote-control drivers as browser backends.
- Added `LICENSE-MIT`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and GitHub Actions
  CI for format, clippy, tests, doc tests, rustdoc warnings, file limits, and
  package verification.
- Added `check_file_limits.sh` and `check_file_limits.ps1` to enforce the
  50-line source-file ratchet for changed `src/**/*.rs` files.
- Added VM and ownership regression tests for function-local bindings, moved
  function locals, immutable assignment rejection, and scalar Copy moves.

### Changed

- Prepared crates.io metadata for `0.1.0-alpha.14`, including the canonical
  repository URL, dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license metadata, and a strict package
  include list.
- Split newly expanded source files into focused modules so changed Rust source
  files respect the file-limit ratchet, including CSS layout, selector healing,
  source discovery, and browser support helpers.
- Updated browser capability documentation and the agent browser contract.

### Fixed

- Fixed rustdoc links so `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps`
  passes cleanly.
- Fixed VM function-call binding behavior so parameters and locals use the
  environment path that preserves mutability and move tombstone semantics.
- Fixed static ownership analysis so moving Copy scalar values does not mark
  the source binding as moved.
- Prevented internal/dev artifacts such as `AGENTS.md`, editor files, Docker
  files, benchmark scripts, and `experiments/examples` from entering the crate
  package.

## [0.1.0-alpha.11] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added integration tests that run the core example programs and verify stdout against checked-in golden files.
- Added regression coverage for the use-after-move example's expected ownership error.

## [0.1.0-alpha.8] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Dependency-free JavaScript interpreter (js module) with globals, functions, control flow, arrays, and js_eval.
- Browser JavaScript host bindings (browser_js module) exposing window/document, DOM mutation/querying, events, deterministic timers, and Storage APIs.
- Expanded browser subsystem with richer CSS selector parsing/cascade, structured snapshot and display-list output helpers.
- tetherscript js CLI subcommand for running JavaScript.
- Test coverage for img src attribute in display commands.

### Fixed

- EVENT_REGISTRY thread_local now cleared per evaluation to prevent memory leaks.
- <img src> DOM attribute carried into LayoutBox.styles so DisplayCommand::Image.src is non-empty.

## [0.1.0-alpha.6] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added first-class `Bytes` support across the language pipeline:
  - `Value::Bytes` runtime representation.
  - `b"..."` byte-string literals with `\xNN` escapes.
  - `bytes(...)` builtin for strings, byte lists, and bytes cloning.
  - Bytes indexing, index assignment, iteration, equality, truthiness, and display formatting.
  - Bytes methods: `len`, `push`, `pop`, `decode_utf8`, `to_string`, and `hex`.
- Added static ownership analysis in `src/ownership.rs`.
- Added `tetherscript check <file>` for parse plus statically-resolvable ownership checks.
- Added pre-execution ownership analysis to `tetherscript run`.
- Added VM instruction-budget enforcement for bytecode execution.
- Added `VM::builder()`, `VmBuilder`, and `tetherscript::Vm` re-export for embedders.
- Added tests covering bytes behavior in both interpreter and VM, plus bytes JSON encoding.

### Changed

- `tetherscript run <file>` now uses the bytecode VM by default.
- Added `--interp` / `--tree-walk` to run with the tree-walking interpreter for debugging.
- Normalized prerelease versioning from `0.0.1-alpha-0.5` to `0.1.0-alpha.6`.
- Completed crate metadata for publishing, including repository, readme, keywords, and categories.
- JSON encoding now represents bytes as arrays of integers without an intermediate `Vec<Value>` allocation.
- `bytes.hex()` now avoids per-byte temporary string allocations.

### Fixed

- Fixed VM byte literal semantics so mutable byte constants are deep-cloned on load and do not share buffers across evaluations.
- Fixed duplicate ownership diagnostics for borrow bindings.
- Fixed `fs.read` binary fallback to avoid cloning the entire file buffer when UTF-8 decoding fails.

## [0.1.0-alpha.5] - 2026-05-01

### Changed

- Initial alpha-stable feature publication. Superseded by `0.1.0-alpha.6` with PR review fixes.
